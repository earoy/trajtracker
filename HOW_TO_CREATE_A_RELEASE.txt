Steps for creating a release in TrajTracker:

Before creating the release:
============================
- Run unitests
- Run unitests of "TrajTracker Paradigms" with the new version (to see if TrajTracker paradigms requires upgrading too).
- Update version number in trajtracker/__init__.py
- Make sure that src/ChangeLog.txt is updated
- Generate documentation (in "docs", run "make clean" then "make html"). Verify the documentation is OK.
- Create a distribution file by running src/create_distribution.sh

Creating the release:
=====================
- Commit branch develop
- Merge branch develop into master
- Create a branch for the release
- Merge master back into develop (usually this should do nothing)
- Push all three branches

After creating the release:
===========================
- Upload documentation to the website as "apiref-#.#.#"
- Change the static link "apiref" to point to the latest documentation
- Update the new version in apiref-all.html
