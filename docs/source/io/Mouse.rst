.. TrajTracker : Mouse.py

Mouse class
===========

Interface with the system mouse

This object is set as the default value for :attr:`trajtracker.env.mouse <trajtracker.Environment.mouse>` .

To receive location and clicks information from other devices (which do not behave like a mouse),
you can create another implementation of the "Mouse" class.
