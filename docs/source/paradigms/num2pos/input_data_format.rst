CSV configuration file
======================

The CSV file contains one line per trial. In this file, you define the target location on the number line,
as well as the stimulus to present.

You can also optionally define the times when it appears or disappears, and its position. This will be useful
if you want to change some of these parameters on each trial.

*TBD list columns*
