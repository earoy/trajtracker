Events
++++++


A trial can include the following events:

- *trajtracker.events.TRIAL_INITIALIZED* - when the trial was initialized (right after the previous trial ended)
- *trajtracker.events.TRIAL_STARTED* - when the finger touches the "start" rectangle
- *FINGER_STARTED_MOVING* - when the finger starts moving
- *FINGER_STOPPED_MOVING* - when the finger stops moving (either when a response was made or when the trial failed)
- *trajtracker.events.TRIAL_SUCCEEDED* - when the trial ended successfully (this does not mean that the subject's
  response was good; it only means that some response was made). In case there are post-trial operations
  (e.g., get subjective confidence rating), the event will be dispatched these operations finished.
- *trajtracker.events.TRIAL_FAILED* - when the trial failed, for any reason
- *trajtracker.events.TRIAL_ENDED* - this event is dispatched whenever a TRIAL_SUCCEEDED or TRIAL_FAILED
  events are dispatched.

The operations triggered by events are:

- Showing/hiding stimuli: this happens in certain delay after TRIAL_STARTED (when
  *config.stimulus_then_move = True*) or after FINGER_STARTED_MOVING (when *config.stimulus_then_move = False*)
- Hiding the feedback arrow (runs on TRIAL_STARTED)
- Enabling the `TrajectoryTracker <http://trajtracker.com/apiref/ttrk/movement/TrajectoryTracker.html>`_ and all validators on FINGER_STARTED_MOVING,
  and disabling them on FINGER_STOPPED_MOVING.
