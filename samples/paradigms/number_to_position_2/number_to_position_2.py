"""

A simple version of the number-to-position experiment: 
- 0-100 number line
- Targets are printed as "decade+unit" (provided in a CSV file)
- The decade addend appears first, and after 100 ms the unit addend
- The color of the feedback arrow changes according to the response accuracy (endpoint error), 
  and so does the acknowledgement sound.
- The correct location is shown with the feedback
- Support both stimulus-then-move and move-then-stimulus modes

Changing during the trial (first decade, then decade+unit) is acheived by defining TWO stimuli per trial.
Both are defined in a single MultiTextBox object (exp_info.target). To define when one stimulus changes
into the other, the MultiTextBox defines "onset_time" and "duration" for each of the two per-trial stimuli.

Defining onset_time and duration could have been done by adding two columns with this name to the
number_to_position_2.csv file. However, here I used a different method: I defined MultiTextBox.onset_time and
MultiTextBox.duration in advance, only once, when initializing the experiment. To allow this, I had to 
copy the trajtracker.paradigms.num2pos.run_full_experiment() function and make a small modification.
