Version 0.5.0
=============

Paradigms:
* Discrete choice paradigm: saving information about the response buttons in the session.xml file
* Num2Pos paradigm: renamed some fields in the session.xml file
* Changed where we call stimuli.present() in the trial loop, so not to lose the first frame
* Num2Pos: removed run_full_experiment()
* Validating subject ID - allow only a subset of characters, which are accepted in file names and as matlab struct keys
